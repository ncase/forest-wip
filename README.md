All My Shiz Is Public Domain

With the exception of the code/assets listed below,
I made all the words and code in this explorable explanation,
and guess what? I'm giving it all away!

That's right, I'm dedicating it all to the public domain.
(via [Creative Commons Zero](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/))

That means if you want to use it in your classroom, your newsroom, your boardroom,
your bedroom, your blogroom, your chatroom, your maxheadroom, or whatever other rooms
you have, *you already have my permission!*

Attribution is always appreciated, but I'm not going to send legal goons after you for it.

Other Peeps' Code I Used

**For the interactive blog post:** (all MIT licensed)

* [Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) - For the fancy footnotes.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Makes JavaScript less crappy. Also, required for Bigfoot.

**For the model-maker tool:** (all MIT licensed)

* [MinPubSub](https://github.com/daniellmb/MinPubSub) - A tiny publish/subscribe library.
* [Perfect Scrollbar](http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/) - Custom scrollbars. Mostly because Mac OS X Lion is silly and hides all the scrollbars because 'minimalism'.
* [requestAnimationFrame shim](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) - A requestAnimationFrame polyfill.
* [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest) - A tiny XMLHttpRequest library.
