<!-- MAIN ESSAY -->
<div class="words">

<p>
A few years ago, I was hiking alone in the woods.
The forest was calm, quiet, so of course,
I got totally bored and checked Twitter.
</p>

<p>
What's new, I wondered?
Ah, another terrorist attack,
some financial crisis,
a GIF that's going viral,
a virus that's going viral,
crime, corruption, and environmental collapse...
so, nothing new.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the trees, a bird tweeted.
</p>

<p>
Despair seems to be a common feeling nowadays.
I know <i>I</i> often feel helpless.
But recently, I learnt that
a bunch of scientists, from different fields,
are finding patterns
in <i>all</i> the complex systems they study.
And now, they're creating new ways
not just to understand the systems of our world,
but maybe <i>change</i> them as well!
</p>

<p>
Tell me, what's an issue in your city/country/planet you care about?
<br>
<input type="text" style="width:100%;"
	name="your_issue" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="(no seriously, type it in here)"></input>
</p>

<p>
There are <i>systems</i> around that problem &mdash;
social, economic, technological, and/or political systems.
Today, I'd like to help you understand those systems a bit better,
find new ways to tackle the problem,
and <i>create your very own simulation!</i>
I want to share what I'm still learning about complex systems,
and to explain it...
</p>

<p>
...I'll need to simulate a forest in emoji.
ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Trees Pop Outta Nowhere

	<!--div id="description">
		In every simulation you'll play with here, you can edit <i>everything</i>.
		All the rules, all the art, all the words.

		Try changing how fast trees grow, or change "ðŸŒ²" to a different emoji!

Back then,
I used to live in California,
which was (and still is) going through a rather nasty drought,
causing a season of disastrous forest fires.
Forests are complex ecosystems.
And as it turns out, wildfires
&mdash;
and human squabbles over what to do about them
&mdash;
are just part of that system.
</p>

<!-- EMERGENCE. BOTTOM UP. -->

<p>
We're going to slowly build up a simulation of that.
Step by step,
you'll discover how complex results
<b>emerge</b> from simple rules,
from the bottom up.
You'll learn some counterintuitive things about
forests, and what they have in common with
<i>every other system in the world.</i>
Yes, including
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[what! you didn't tell me what issue you care about! whaaat!]</b>"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Let's add two new rules to this simulation.
</p>

<p>
All trees have a small chance of getting hit by lightning,
and catching on fire.
(ðŸŒ²&rarr;ðŸ”¥)
Also, any tree next to fire also catches on fire.
(ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²&rarr;ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)
These new rules <i>decrease</i> trees, so
what do you think happens now, when you <i>increase</i> tree growth?
</p>

<form name="predict_fire" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="more" checked>
	ðŸŒ²ðŸ“ˆ&rarr;ðŸŒ²ðŸ“ˆ: More trees lead to more trees.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="less">
	ðŸŒ²ðŸ“ˆ&rarr;ðŸŒ²ðŸ“‰: More trees lead to fewer trees.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="none">
	Neither.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="both">
	Both... somehow.
</label>
</form>

</p>

<p>
Don't worry, this question isn't to judge you,
it's only for <i>you</i> to express your prediction!
Now, let's find out what happens...

Here's the format:
1. reflect on prediction
2. new framework idea
3. apply new idea
4. new rules, set up expectations for failure
5. make a prediction

-->

<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

<span value="more">
You predicted that more trees would lead to more trees,
and that's a totally reasonable prediction!
However, in this case, intuition fails.
More is not more.
Here, more is <i>less</i>.
This counterintuitive result is because
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
(And afterwards,
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats)
</span>

<!--span value="less">
You predicted that more trees would lead to <i>less</i> trees.
Clever! However, it only came half-true.
I assume you figured out that
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
But this logic goes further:
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.

Well, I mean, I was.
