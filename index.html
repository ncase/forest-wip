<!-- MAIN ESSAY -->
<div class="words">

<p>
Normally, authors start by naming a topic <i>they</i> care about.
But today, it’s about <i>you</i>.
Tell me, what Big Problem in your city/country/planet
do <i>you</i> care about?
</p>

<input type="text"
	style="font-size:25px; margin:5px 0 10px 0;"
	name="your_issue" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="(yes, actually type it in here!)"></input>

<p>
Of course, there’s <i>lots</i> of Big Problems out there:
terrorist attacks and territorial wars,
the environment and the economy,
injustice and inequality,
this and that, on and on.
All these are complex systems with complex problems,
and faced with all that jazz,
despair is understandable.
Despair is normal.
</p>

<p>
But despair is not <i>useful</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is one thing that still gives me hope.
I recently learnt that a bunch of scientists
from different fields got together,
and found patterns in <i>all</i> the systems they study.
And now, they’re creating new ways
&mdash;
arguably, a whole new kind of <i>science</i>
&mdash;
to understand complex systems,
and just maybe, change them too!
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[no really, type in your Big Problem above]"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Remember, this post is for <i>you</i>.
I want to share what I’m still learning about systems,
share that hope,
and help you <i>actually</i> apply this to
the Big Problem <i>you</i> care about.
You’ll learn how to see things as systems,
how to tackle them,
and at the end,
you’ll get to <i>create your very own simulation.</i>
</p>

<p>
And to start, let’s simulate some happy little trees. 🌲🌲🌲
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Trees Pop Outta Nowhere

</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
A little personal background:
I used to live in California for a couple years.
Back then, it was (and still is)
going through a rather nasty drought,
causing a season of disastrous forest fires.
That was our Big Problem.

Forests are complex systems,
but we can still build up a basic simulation of them.
Step by step, you’ll see
how simple rules can lead to complex results,

<!--You'll also discover some counterintuitive stuff about forests,

and learn what forests
have in common with <i>all complex systems</i>.
Yes, including 
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[type in your Big Problem, pleeeeease?]"></span>!
</p>

<p>
Let’s add two more rules to our fake forest:
</p>

<p>
1. &#x2B1C;→🌲: Blank spots grow trees. (original rule)
<br>
2. 🌲→🔥: Trees sometimes get hit by lightning & catch on fire.
<br>
3. 🔥🌲→🔥🔥: Any tree next to a fire also catches on fire.
</p>

<p>
What do you think happens now, when you increase tree growth?
Make a guess below!
(Don’t worry, this question isn’t to <i>judge</i> or <i>grade</i> you,
it’s solely for you to express your prediction.)

<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

<span value="more">
You predicted that more trees would lead to more trees,
and that's a totally reasonable prediction!
However, in this case, intuition fails.
More is not more.
Here, more is <i>less</i>.
This counterintuitive result is because
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
(And afterwards,
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats)
</span>

<span value="less">
You said that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees.
Clever! However, your prediction only came half-true.
I assume you figured out that
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
But this logic goes further:
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.
</span>

<span value="none">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
neither more trees nor fewer trees.
Heh, you must've thought I was giving you a trick question.
Well, I mean, I was.
Anyway, it turns out increasing the growth rate
would create a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
repeat cycle.
</span>

<span value="both">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
both more <i>and</i> less trees?
That makes no sense.
And yet, you're totally right!
Increasing the growth rate
creates a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.

<p>
Simple rules to complex results, <i>from the bottom up.</i>
</p>

<p>
🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
</p>

<p>
We’re all so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect,
“A affects B”. But, as scientists have discovered,
most of the world is actually <i>nonlinear</i>,
where A affects B affects A affects B, etc.
This is called a <b>feedback loop</b>.
Loops are a new way of looking at the world.
Now, I’d like to break down your complex Big Problem,
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[pleeeeease]"></span>,
into little loops.
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of loops.
The first is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
when more of something leads to even more of itself.
For example, in the above simulation,
fire leads to more fire.
What reinforcing loops can you think of,
that helps/worsens your Big Problem?
</p>

<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="reinforcing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. an arms race: we get some bombs, so they get more bombs in response, so we get even *more* bombs in response, oh shiiiii--"></textarea>

<p>
Good! Now, the second kind of loop is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
when more of something leads to less of itself.
The growth-and-burning cycle you (saw above|half-predicted|predicted) is a good example.
Think of the reinforcing loops you listed above.
What things <i>prevent</i> them from escalating to infinity?
Those are your balancing loops! List ‘em here:
</p>

<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="balancing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. supply & demand: if the price is too low, lots of people will want to buy it, which will drive the price back up, oh shiiiii--"></textarea>

<p>
Now that you’ve broken down your Big Problem into loops,
into a <i>system</i>, how do we actually <i>change</i> these systems?
Well, since our forest system is just a simulation,
we can do all kinds of wacky stuff to it.
Such as… what if Smokey The Bear finally flips his lid,
and starts killing trees left and right?
</p>

<p>
So, if you’ll just <i>bear</i> with me for a moment…
</p>

</div>

<!--

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_bears&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Yup.
You made a forest thicker...
by deliberately killing trees.
This is because by removing trees,
you break the reinforcing loop of
fire catching its neighbors on fire.
<i>That's</i> how you change a system.
Not by fiddling with numbers,
but <i>changing the feedback loops</i>.
</p>

<p>
Okay. At this point, you might be thinking I'm full of 💩.
It's not like forest firefighters
go out and kill trees,
except... that's exactly what they do!
If you've ever heard the phrase
“fight fire with fire”,
that comes from the practice of
doing controlled burns,
to get rid of flammable material
before a wildfire can spread through it.
</p>

<p>
Let's kill some trees again.
But first &mdash;
a forest wouldn't be an ecosystem with just one plant type.
So, let's have two species:
</p>

<p>
🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
invincible to fire, but if four or more of its neighbors are Jerk Weeds,
it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
</p>

<p>
🌱 <b>Jerk Weed:</b>
flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as Strong Trees.
</p>

<p>
First, make a prediction.
<i>Without</i> your walls of fire-containing bears, how will the plants interact?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_1" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Strong Trees and Jerk Weeds will be somewhat equal.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
Then <i>with</i> your fire protections,
how will the plants interact now?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_2" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Strong Trees and Jerk Weeds will be somewhat equal.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
And here we go again...
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Some Plants Are Jerks
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/3_plants&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
HA HA THAT'S MY ENTIRE DRAFT SO FAR, I'M SUCH A TEASE.
</p>

<p>
Anyway yeah let me know what your thoughts are so far!
Is this playable post <i>actually</i> getting you to think about
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[why must you hurt me in this way]</b>"></span>
in a new way, through systems?
Or are you just kinda skipping over those.
What parts bore you, or seem irrelevant or too weird?
How's the whole flow of the piece, is it too text-heavy?
Was the introduction too long?

<p>
Honest feedback is best.
And again, thank you so so much! 😘
