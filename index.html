<!-- MAIN ESSAY -->
<div class="words">

<p>
A few years ago, I was hiking alone in the woods,
in beautiful Santa Cruz, California.
The forest was calm, quiet, peaceful, so of course,
I got frikkin' bored and decided to check Twitter.
</p>

<p>
What's new, I wondered?
Ah, another tragic shooting,
some financial crisis,
a GIF that's going viral,
a virus that's going viral,
crime, corruption, and environmental collapse...
</p>

<p>
...so, nothing new, then.

IS THE INTRO TOO LONG?
Try long first, then cut down.
Cut it IF "too long" OR doesn't react emotionally, ground it emotionally.

<p>
Despair seems to be a common feeling nowadays.
I know <i>I</i> often feel helpless to change anything.
I'm just a part of the system,
a tree in this forest, and if I were to fall,
would I make a sound?
</p>

<p>
There is one thing, though, that gives me hope.
I recently learnt that a few scientists, from vastly different fields,
have gotten together and found patterns
in <i>all</i> the complex systems they study.
Now, they're discovering new ways for us
to understand the systems of our world,
and just maybe, change them as well!
</p>

<p>
Tell me, what's an issue in your city/country/planet <i>you</i> care about?
<br>
<input type="text"

	placeholder="(no seriously, type it in here)"></input>
</p>

<p>
There are <i>systems</i> around that problem &mdash;
social, economic, technological, and/or political systems.
Today, I'd like to help you understand those systems a bit better,
find new ways to tackle that problem,
and <i>create your very own simulation!</i>
I want to share what I'm still learning about complex systems,
and to explain it...
</p>

<p>
...I'll need to simulate a forest in emoji.

Anyway, I used to live in California,
which was (and still is) going through a nasty drought,
causing a season of disastrous wildfires.
Forests are complex ecosystems.
And wildfires,
plus the human squabbles over what to do about them,
are just part of that system.
</p>

<p>
We're going to simulate that.
Step by step,
you'll discover how simple rules lead to complex results,
from the bottom up.
<!--<b>“Emergence”</b>,
as it's called.-->
Along the way,
you'll learn some counterintuitive things about
forests, and what they have in common with
<i>every other system in the world.</i>

<p>
Yes, including
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[what! you didn't tell me what issue you care about! whaaat!]</b>"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Let's add two new rules to this simulation.
Trees can get hit by lightning and catch on fire.
(🌲&rarr;🔥)
Also, any tree next to fire also catches on fire.
(🔥🌲&rarr;🔥🔥)
These new rules <i>decrease</i> trees;
what do you think happens now, when you <i>increase</i> tree growth?

<p>
Don't worry, this question isn't to judge you,
it's only for <i>you</i> to express your prediction!
Now, let's find out what happens...

<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

<span value="more">
You predicted that more trees would lead to more trees,
and that's a totally reasonable prediction!
However, in this case, intuition fails.
More is not more.
Here, more is <i>less</i>.
This counterintuitive result is because
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
(And afterwards,
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats)
</span>

<span value="less">
You said that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees.
Clever! However, your prediction only came half-true.
I assume you figured out that
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
But this logic goes further:
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.
</span>

<span value="none">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
neither more trees nor fewer trees.
Heh, you must've thought I was giving you a trick question.
Well, I mean, I was.
Anyway, it turns out increasing the growth rate
would create a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
repeat cycle.
</span>

<span value="both">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
both more <i>and</i> less trees?
That makes no sense.
And yet, you're totally right!
Increasing the growth rate
creates a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.

We're so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect,
A-affects-B.
But the world's filled
with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
where A-affects-B-affects-A-affects-B, to infinity.
There's two kinds of feedback loops:
<b>reinforcing loops</b>,
like fire making more fire,
and
<b>balancing loops</b>,
like the above burn-grow cycle.
</p>

<p>
Loops are a new way to look at the world.
Think about <span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[please i'm begging you, tell me what big issue you care about]</b>"></span> again.
What reinforcing loops do you think affect it?
<br>
<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="reinforcing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. an arms race: we get some bombs, so they get more bombs in response, so we get even *more* bombs in response, oh shiiiii--"></textarea>
</p>

<p>
Now, what about balancing loops?
<br>
<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="balancing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. supply & demand: if the price is too low, lots of people will want to buy it, which will drive the price back up, oh shiiiii--"></textarea>
</p>
</p>

<p>
You just did the most important step:
to move beyond the linear mindset, and think in <i>systems.</i>
But now, how do we change those systems?
Since our forest is just a simulation, we can try out wacky ideas,
like what if Smokey The Bear finally flips his lid and starts killing trees?
If you'll <i>bear</i> with me for a moment...
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_bears&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Yup.
You made a forest thicker...
by deliberately killing trees.
This is because by removing trees,
you break the reinforcing loop of
fire catching its neighbors on fire.
<i>That's</i> how you change a system.
Not by fiddling with numbers,
but <i>changing the feedback loops</i>.
</p>

<p>
Okay. At this point, you might be thinking I'm full of 💩.
It's not like forest firefighters
go out and kill trees,
except... that's exactly what they do!
If you've ever heard the phrase
“fight fire with fire”,
that comes from the practice of
doing controlled burns,
to get rid of flammable material
before a wildfire can spread through it.
</p>

<p>
Let's kill some trees again.
But first &mdash;
a forest wouldn't be an ecosystem with just one plant type.
So, let's have two species:
</p>

<p>
🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
invincible to fire, but if four or more of its neighbors are Jerk Weeds,
it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
</p>

<p>
🌱 <b>Jerk Weed:</b>
flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as Strong Trees.
</p>

<p>
First, make a prediction.
<i>Without</i> your walls of fire-containing bears, how will the plants interact?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_1" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Strong Trees and Jerk Weeds will be somewhat equal.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
Then <i>with</i> your fire protections,
how will the plants interact now?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_2" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Strong Trees and Jerk Weeds will be somewhat equal.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
And here we go again...
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Some Plants Are Jerks
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/3_plants&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
HA HA THAT'S MY ENTIRE DRAFT SO FAR, I'M SUCH A TEASE.
</p>

<p>
Anyway yeah let me know what your thoughts are so far!
Is this playable post <i>actually</i> getting you to think about
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[why must you hurt me in this way]</b>"></span>
in a new way, through systems?
Or are you just kinda skipping over those.
What parts bore you, or seem irrelevant or too weird?
How's the whole flow of the piece, is it too text-heavy?
Was the introduction too long?
</p>

<p>
Honest feedback is best.
And again, thank you so so much! 😘
