<p>
A few years ago, I was hiking alone in the woods.
The forest was calm, quiet, so of course,
I got totally bored and checked Twitter.
</p>

<p>
What's new, I wondered?
Ah, another terrorist attack,
some financial crisis,
a GIF that's going viral,
a virus that's going viral,
crime, corruption, and environmental collapse...
so, nothing new.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the trees, a bird tweeted.
</p>

<p>
Despair seems to be a common feeling nowadays.
I know <i>I</i> often feel helpless.
But recently, I learnt that
a bunch of scientists, from different fields,
are finding patterns
in <i>all</i> the complex systems they study.
And now, they're creating new ways
not just to understand the systems of our world,
but maybe <i>change</i> them as well!
</p>

<p>
Tell me, what's an issue in your city/country/planet you care about?
<br>
<input type="text"
	name="your_issue" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="(no seriously, type it in here)"></input>
</p>

<p>
There are <i>systems</i> around that problem &mdash;
social, economic, technological, and/or political systems.
Today, I'd like to help you understand those systems a bit better,
find new ways to tackle the problem,
and <i>create your very own simulation!</i>
I want to share what I'm still learning about complex systems,
and to explain it...
</p>

<p>
...I'll need to simulate a forest in emoji.

Back then,
I used to live in California,
which was (and still is) going through a rather nasty drought,
causing a season of disastrous forest fires.
Forests are complex ecosystems.
And as it turns out, wildfires
&mdash;
and human squabbles over what to do about them
&mdash;
are just part of that system.
</p>

<!-- EMERGENCE. BOTTOM UP. -->

<p>
We're going to simulate that.
Step by step,
you'll discover how simple rules lead to complex results,
<b>emergence</b>
from the bottom up.
You'll learn counterintuitive things about
forests, and what they have in common with
<i>every other system in the world.</i>

<p>
Yes, including
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[what! you didn't tell me what issue you care about! whaaat!]</b>"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Let's add two new rules to this simulation.
</p>

<p>
All trees have a small chance of getting hit by lightning,
and catching on fire.
(🌲&rarr;🔥)
Also, any tree next to fire also catches on fire.
(🔥🌲&rarr;🔥🔥)
These new rules <i>decrease</i> trees, so
what do you think happens now, when you <i>increase</i> tree growth?

<p>
Don't worry, this question isn't to judge you,
it's only for <i>you</i> to express your prediction!
Now, let's find out what happens...

<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

<span value="more">
You predicted that more trees would lead to more trees,
and that's a totally reasonable prediction!
However, in this case, intuition fails.
More is not more.
Here, more is <i>less</i>.
This counterintuitive result is because
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
(And afterwards,
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats)
</span>

<span value="less">
You said that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees.
Clever! However, your prediction only came half-true.
I assume you figured out that
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
But this logic goes further:
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.
</span>

<span value="none">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
neither more trees nor fewer trees.
Heh, you must've thought I was giving you a trick question.
Well, I mean, I was.
Anyway, it turns out increasing the growth rate
would create a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
repeat cycle.
</span>

<span value="both">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
both more <i>and</i> less trees?
That makes no sense.
And yet, you're totally right!
Increasing the growth rate
creates a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.

<p>
We're so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect,
A-affects-B.
But the world's filled
with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
where A-affects-B-affects-A-affects-B, to infinity.
There's two kinds of feedback loops:
<b>reinforcing loops</b>,
like fire making more fire,
and
<b>balancing loops</b>,
like the above burn-grow cycle.
</p>

<p>
Loops are a new way to look at the world,
through <i>systems</i>.
Think about <span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="<b>[WHAT THING DO YOU CARE ABOUT]</b>"></span> again.
Can you find reinforcing loops behind it?
<br>
<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="reinforcing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. an arms race (oh no), an invention that leads to more inventions (oh yes)"></textarea>
</p>

<p>
What about balancing loops?
<br>
<!-- NEED A BETTER EXAMPLE -->
<textarea style="font-size:16px; height:70px;"
	name="balancing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="e.g. if something's too expensive, people will want it less, and so the price drops."></textarea>
</p>
</p>

<p>
You just did the first important step:
to move out of linear thinking, and see in <i>systems.</i>
Now, how do we change those systems?
Since our forest is just a simulation, we can try out all kinds of wacky ideas,
like what if Smokey The Bear finally loses it and starts killing trees?
So, if you'll <i>bear</i> with me for a moment...
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires

	<!--div id="description">

	<iframe src="mode?local=forest&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Yup.
You made a thicker forest with more trees...
by <i>deliberately killing</i> trees.
This happens because, by removing trees,
you <i>break</i> the reinforcing loop of
fire catching its neighbors on fire.
That's how you change a system,
not by fiddling with numbers,
but <i>changing the feedback loops</i>.
</p>

<p>
Okay. At this point, you might be thinking I'm full of 💩.
It's not like forest firefighters
go out and kill trees,
except... that's exactly what they do!
If you've ever heard the phrase
“fight fire with fire”,
that comes from the practice of
doing controlled burns,
to get rid of flammable material
before a wildfire can spread through it.
</p>

<p>
Let's kill some trees again, 
but first:
a forest wouldn't be an ecosystem with just one plant type.
So, here are two species:
</p>

<p>
🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
invincible to fire, but if four or more of its neighbors are Jerk Weeds,
it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
</p>

<p>
🌱 <b>Jerk Weed:</b>
flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as Strong Trees.
</p>

<p>
First, make a prediction.
<i>Without</i> your walls of bears, how will the plants interact?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_1" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Strong Trees and Jerk Weeds will be somewhat equal.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
Then predict: <i>with</i> your walls,
how will the plants interact now?
</p>

<form name="predict_species_2" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
