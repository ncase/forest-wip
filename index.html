<p>
Normally, authors start with a topic <i>they</i> care about.
But today, it’s about <i>you</i>.
Tell me, what Big Problem in your city/country/planet
do <i>you</i> care about?
</p>

<input type="text"

<p>
Of course, there’s lots of Big Problems out there:
terrorism and trafficking,
the environment and the economy,
injustice and inequality,
this and that, on and on.
These are <b>complex systems</b> with complex problems,
and faced with all that,
despair is understandable.
Despair is normal.
But despair is not <i>useful</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can &mdash; and must &mdash; understand the <i>systems</i> of our world.
I think one good way to understand a system is to <i>see</i> it,
with simulations.
As it turns out,
a growing movement of scientists, engineers, and policymakers
are <i>already</i> using simulations to explore and explain
complex systems...
</p>

<p>...such as
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[no really, type in your Big Problem]"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Remember, this article is for <i>you</i>.
I want to share what I’m still learning about complex systems,
and help you <i>apply</i> these ideas to
the Big Problem <i>you</i> care about.
You'll learn how to see things in systems,
find ways to tackle them,
and at the end of this,
you'll <i>create your very own simulation.</i>
</p>

<p>
To start, let’s simulate some happy little trees. 🌲🌲🌲
</p>

<!--p>
There is one thing that still gives me hope.
I recently learnt that a bunch of scientists
from different fields got together,
and found patterns in <i>all</i> the systems they study.
And now, they’re creating new ways
&mdash;
arguably, a whole new kind of <i>science</i>
&mdash;
to understand complex systems,
and just maybe, change them too!

I used to live in California for a couple years.
Back then, it was (and still is)
going through a rather nasty drought,
causing a season of disastrous forest fires.
That was our Big Problem.

Forests are complex systems,

Let’s add another rule to our fake forest:
sometimes, trees will get hit by lightning &amp; catch on fire.

<span value="more">
You predicted that more trees would lead to more trees,
and that's a totally reasonable prediction!
However, in this case, intuition fails.
More is not more.
Here, more is <i>less</i>.
This counterintuitive result is because
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
(And afterwards,
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats)
</span>

<span value="less">
You said that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees.
Clever! However, your prediction only came half-true.
I assume you figured out that
more trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire can spread further &rarr;
fewer trees.
But this logic goes further:
fewer trees &rarr;
fire can't spread as far &rarr;
trees can grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.
</span>

<span value="none">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
neither more trees nor fewer trees.
Heh, you must've thought I was giving you a trick question.
Well, I mean, I was.
Anyway, it turns out increasing the growth rate
would create a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
repeat cycle.
</span>

<span value="both">
You predicted that more trees would lead to...
both more <i>and</i> less trees?
That makes no sense.
And yet, you're totally right!
Increasing the growth rate
creates a cycle of more <i>and</i> less trees.
More trees &rarr;
thicker forest &rarr;
fire spreads further &rarr;
fewer trees &rarr;
fire spreads less &rarr;
more trees grow back &rarr;
the cycle repeats,
and the higher the growth rate,
the more extreme the cycle is.

<p>
Simple rules to complex results, <i>from the bottom up.</i>
</p>

<p>
🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
</p>

<p>
We're so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect, A-affects-B.
But the world's filled with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
where A-affects-B-affects-A-affects-B, to infinity.

<!--most of the world is actually <i>nonlinear</i>,
where A affects B affects A affects B, etc.
This is called a <b>feedback loop</b>.
Loops are a new way of looking at the world.
Now, I’d like to break down your complex Big Problem,
<span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[pleeeeease]"></span>,
into little loops.-->
</p>

<p>
One kind of feedback loop is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
when a thing leads to more of itself.
(e.g. 🔥📈→🔥📈: fire makes more fire)
Think of <span name="your_issue" class="reader_output"
	placeholder="[pleeeeease]"></span> again.
What reinforcing loops, good <i>and</i> bad, affect your Big Problem?
</p>

<textarea style="height:120px;"
	name="reinforcing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="Example #1: an arms race between two countries. Example #2: when someone joins a cause, that influences their friends to also join the cause, and so on."></textarea>

<p>
The other kind of loop is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
when more leads to less,
then less leads to more.
(e.g. the above 🌲📈→🌲📉→🌲📈 cycle)
Finding balancing loops is harder,
but here's a trick:
think of the reinforcing loops you wrote down just now.
What things <i>prevent</i> them from growing forever?
Those are your balancing loops!
So, what are the balancing loops in your Big Problem?
</p>

<textarea style="height:120px;"
	name="balancing_loop" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="Example #1: a country in an arms race runs out of money. Example #2: members in a social movement run out of friends willing to join the cause."></textarea>

<p>
Now that you’ve broken down your Big Problem into loops,
how do we <i>change</i> those loops?
Well, since our forest is just a simulation,
we can try out all kinds of wacky stuff to it,
such as… what if Smokey The Bear finally flips his lid
and starts killing trees?
So, if you’ll <i>bear</i> with me for a moment…
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_bears&play=1&edit=1"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Yup. Killing trees actually <i>helps</i> the trees,
by containing the fires.
And yes, forest firefighters actually do this!
That's where “fight fire with fire” comes from:
the practice of doing controlled burns,
to get rid of flammable material before a wildfire can spread through it.
</p>

<p>
By making “walls” of removed trees,
you stop that reinforcing loop of fire making more fire.
<i>That</i> is how you change a system.
Not by fiddling with individual parts,
<i>but by changing the core loops</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Let's make more bear-walls, but first:
a forest isn't an ecosystem with just one plant species.
So, let’s simulate these two plants:
</p>

<p style="text-align:left">
🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
invincible to fire, but if four or more of its neighbors are Jerk Weeds,
it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left">
🌱 <b>Jerk Weed:</b>
flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as the Strong Trees.
Also, sometimes they spontaneously catch on fire.
</p>

<p>
I've balanced these plants so that without your intervention,
they'll get a 50/50 split of the land.
But <i>after</i> you add your walls of fire-containing bears,
how do you think the plants will interact <i>then?</i>
</p>

<form name="predict_species_2" class="reader_choice">
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="tree" checked>
	🌳&gt;🌱: Strong Trees will now beat out the Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="weed">
	🌳&lt;🌱: Strong Trees will now be overrun by Jerk Weeds.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same">
	🌳=🌱: Both plants will still have a somewhat equal share.
</label>
<label>
	<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
	Something completely different.
</label>
</form>

<p>
Now, let's see...
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Some Plants Are Jerks
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/3_plants&play=2&edit=1"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Before we talk about your prediction,
did you notice how the plants formed clusters,
even though <i>no rule told them to?</i>
This is called <b>self-organization</b>,
a weird and wonderful thing about complex systems.
The fact that order can arise from chaos is so unlike everyday life
—
imagine an omelette unscrambling itself
—
yet without it, there wouldn’t even <i>be</i> life!
</p>

<p>
Self-organization doesn’t just come from the individual parts of a system,
it comes from the <i>interactions</i> between them.
Earlier, you broke your Big Problem into loops.
Now, if you please,
break those loops into the <i>individual interactions</i>:
</p>

<p>
<textarea style="height:120px;"
	name="interactions" class="reader_input"
	placeholder="Disease: one person infects another. Economics: two people exchange stuff. Politics: one person's beliefs are influenced by their friends' beliefs."></textarea>
</p>

<p>
Self-organization also allows the system to <i>adapt from the bottom up,</i>
which brings us to your prediction:
[WILL FINISH THIS PART LATER.
BASICALLY, YEAH, FIRE SUPPRESSION ACTUALLY MAKES FORESTS
MORE FLAMMABLE IN THE LONG RUN, WHICH IS A REAL DILEMMA
FIREFIGHTERS FACE]
<!--
(BLAH BLAH BLAH)
[fire suppression made the forest more flammable]
This is an <i>actual</i> dilemma firefighters are still facing,
more on this later.-->
</p>

<p>
Simulations are helpful in <i>explaining</i> complex systems,
but they’re also great for <i>exploring</i> complex systems!
Scientists, businesses, and policymakers all already use
simulations to try out different strategies,
find risks, and weigh tradeoffs.
In this final forest simulation,
you are in charge of saving the forest, <i>and saving lives.</i>
</p>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> With Very Flammable Houses
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/4_houses&play=2&edit=1"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
HA HA THAT'S MY ENTIRE DRAFT SO FAR, I'M SUCH A TEASE.
</p>

<p>
Anyway yeah let me know what your thoughts are so far!
Is this playable post <i>actually</i>
getting you to think about your Big Problem
in a new way, through systems?
Do the free-form questions actually help?
Or are you just kinda skipping over those.
What parts bore you, or seem irrelevant or too weird?
How's the whole flow of the piece, is it too text-heavy?
Was the introduction too long?
Does framing it as "overcoming despair" work, or does it still feel detached?
</p>

<p>
Honest feedback is best.
And again, thank you so so much! 😘
